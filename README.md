Weather Dashboard
1. Project Overview

Objective

The Weather Dashboard project aimed to create a dynamic, user-friendly web application that allows users to search for current weather conditions in various cities and retrieve weather updates for their current location using geolocation.

 By using the OpenWeatherMap API, the application provides real-time weather data including hourly forecasts, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Features

3. 5-day  Forecast: In addition to the current weather, the dashboard provides a 5-day forecast, giving users an extended outlook for future weather conditions.

4. Responsive Design: The application is mobile-friendly, ensuring an optimal user experience on various devices.

5. Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark modes for a customized viewing experience.
